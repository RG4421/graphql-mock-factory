# graphql-mock-factory

A JavaScript library to easily generate mock GraphQL responses. The main usecase to write robust tests with minimum boilerplate. It's essentially similar to the mocking functionality of graphql-tools but has different design goals.

# Design goals

- Focus on the usecase of generating customized mock data in tests
- Make it completely obvious how to write a mock function
- Deep merge mock values, objects and lists in a completely unambiguous manner
- Provide helpful validation and error messages
- Encourage teams to write and share sensible base mocks
